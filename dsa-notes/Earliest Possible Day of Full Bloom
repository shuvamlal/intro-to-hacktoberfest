Problem Statement
...........................
You have n flower seeds. Every seed must be planted first before it can begin to grow, then bloom. Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a seed. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays plantTime and growTime, of length n each:

plantTime[i] is the number of full days it takes you to plant the ith seed. Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You do not have to work on planting the same seed on consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not complete until you have worked plantTime[i] days on planting it in total.
growTime[i] is the number of full days it takes the ith seed to grow after being completely planted. After the last day of its growth, the flower blooms and stays bloomed forever.
From the beginning of day 0, you can plant the seeds in any order.

Return the earliest possible day where all seeds are blooming.

 

Example 1:


Input: plantTime = [1,4,3], growTime = [2,3,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.
One optimal way is:
On day 0, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 3.
On days 1, 2, 3, and 4, plant the 1st seed. The seed grows for 3 full days and blooms on day 8.
On days 5, 6, and 7, plant the 2nd seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.
Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.
Example 2:


Input: plantTime = [1,2,3,2], growTime = [2,1,2,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.
One optimal way is:
On day 1, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 4.
On days 0 and 3, plant the 1st seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 5.
On days 2, 4, and 5, plant the 2nd seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 8.
On days 6 and 7, plant the 3rd seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 9.
Thus, on day 9, all the seeds are blooming.
Example 3:

Input: plantTime = [1], growTime = [1]
Output: 2
Explanation: On day 0, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 1 full day and blooms on day 2.
Thus, on day 2, all the seeds are blooming.
 

Constraints:

n == plantTime.length == growTime.length
1 <= n <= 105
1 <= plantTime[i], growTime[i] <= 104


Approach
......................
It is straightforward that the answer can not be less than T0 = sum(plantTime) + min(growTime).
Thus, for optimal strategy, the plant with minimal growth time should be planted last.
Now,, we're left with n-1 plants where the same logic applies.
Thus, we come to a conclusion that plants should be planted according to the reverse-sorted list of growth time.
Now let's count time. Is T0 the final answer? No, it might so happen, that on each iteration the time accumulated on previous steps surpasses the contribution from the current step. Thus, we need to account for this by taking appropriate max-values.
To VISUALLY calculate the minimal time according the strategy above, just run this code that will basically plot the timeline. The length of the longest string is the answer.



Solution

class Solution:
    def earliestFullBloom(self, plantTime: List[int], growTime: List[int]) -> int:
        
        min_time = acc_plant = 0

        for grow, cur_plant in reversed(sorted(zip(growTime, plantTime))):
            acc_plant += cur_plant
            min_time = max(min_time, acc_plant + grow)
            
        return min_time
